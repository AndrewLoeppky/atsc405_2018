# Readme Goes Here


## Andrew's Metpy Mods

My documentation for re-doing the thermodiagram portion of the course with the metpy package. The goal is to balance delivering useful skills like making pro-looking thermodiagrams and using state of the art tools versus developing a deeper understanding of what thermodiagrams are and what all the curves actually represent. 

### Do it with metpy:

#### Install metpy in the course environment

```
$ mamba install metpy 
```
