# # Tompkins practice quesitons

# 1\.  Buoyancy and stability
# Questions
# 
# i)  (3pt) Our by-now familiar air parcel of moist (but non-cloudy)
# air has a temperature of 24.9 deg C. It is neutrally buoyant sitting in an
# environment that has a temperature of 25 deg C and a mixing ratio of 10
# $g kg^{-1}$. What is the mixing ratio in the air parcel?

# In[3]:


#your code here
from a405.thermo.constants import constants as c
# c.delta = 0.608
rvenv = 1.e-2
Tenv = c.Tc + 25
Tparcel = c.Tc + 24.9
Tvenv = Tenv*(1. + c.delta*rvenv)
#Tvparcel = Tparcel*(1 + c.delta*rvparcel)
#want Tvparcel = Tvenv
rvparcel =(Tvenv/Tparcel - 1)/c.delta
print('rvparcel: {:5.3f} g/kg'.format(rvparcel*1.e3))


# ii (2pt) the temperature of the air parcel is increased by 1 deg C, so
# that it is no longer neutrally buoyant. Assuming the resulting
# acceleration is maintained (i.e. constant) for 10 seconds, what is the
# final parcel velocity?

# In[4]:


#your code here
Tparcelp1 = Tparcel + 1
Tvparcel = Tparcelp1*(1 + c.delta*rvparcel)
buoy = c.g0*(Tvparcel - Tvenv)/Tvenv
print('parcel vel at 10 seconds={:5.3f} m/s'.format(buoy*10))


# iii (2 pt) Dry air at 1000 hPa is measured to have a temperature of
# 27oC, while at 900 hPa the temperature is 22 deg C, is this layer of the
# atmosphere dry stable, neutral or unstable?

# In[5]:


#your code here
temp1 = c.Tc + 27
press1 = 1.e3
p0 = 1.e3
theta1 = temp1*(p0/press1)**(c.Rd/c.cpd)
temp2 = c.Tc + 22
press2 = 9.e2
theta2 = temp2*(p0/press2)**(c.Rd/c.cpd)
print('theta1, theta2 stable',theta1,theta2)


# 2\. Fog
# 
# In this question, for simplicity, assume the definition of relative humidity 
# defined in terms of mixing ratio: RH = $r_v/r_{vsat}$
# 
# i (2pt) The environmental air with temperature of 25.0 deg C and a mixing
# ratio of 10 $g kg^{-1}$ is located near the surface at a pressure of
# 1000hPa. What is the relative humidity?
# 
#  ii (1pt) The air starts to cool isobarically at night until even-
#  tually a fog forms. Assuming the pressure is 1000 hPa. What is the
#  temperature at which the fogs occurs? (Use the tephigram to answer
#  this, please mark the answer on the tephigram)
# 
# iii (2pt) Derive this same temperature by inverting Tetonâ€™s formula,
# showing your working. (Out of interest note how close the answer is to
# your tephigram result).
# 
# iv (1pt) What is the common name given to this temperature?

# In[10]:

# 3\.  Relative humidity
# 
# In this question, for simplicity, assume the definition of relative
# humidity defined in terms of mixing ratio.
# 
# i (2pt) A parcel of air at time t=0 has a temperature T0 of 25 deg C and a
# relative humidity RH of 0.1. What is the mixing ratio $r_{v0}$?
# 
# ii (4pt) The parcel is cooled and moistened isobarically by the evaporation of precipitation to reach a final temperature 
# of $T_1$ and a final mixing ratio of $r_{v1}$.  Use a rootfinder to solve for $T_1$ if the relative humidity is RH=0.6.
